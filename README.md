Materials for my Test Dive 2024 talk "Unit Testing in Go"

## 1. The code
The code shoud run "out ouf the box" - just put clone it and go
(all puns intended)

CLI commands are as follows:

`go run .` will run your main
`go test .` will run all the tests `-v` will give you verbose mode

Feel free to comment/uncomment parts of the code and see what happens. 

I recommend VSC with Go plugin if you need an IDE. You can run test directly from it. 

## 2. The presentation

You should run it in presentation mode, as it contains animations. In browse mode some pics may hide under the others. There are some comments in slide notes, so check them out too. 

## 3. Other resources

- I publish regularily in polish ["Programista" magazine](https://programistamag.pl/). So far there are two articles about Go, one on unit testing in 2/2023 (107) issue, and another one on generics in 2/2024 (112). I also write embedded systems, FreeRTOS, software architecture and lighter stuff (like managing your manager or the true cost of using "free software"). Some people consider the latter category to be not completely unfunny. YMMV.

- I've took part in DevRing conference in 2021 where we did a unit testing Go vs Java sparring. You can find the [recording here](https://youtu.be/tOvarQhqC_E?si=o6FL-Qg-kdULpZq9&t=312). 

- I'm a regular speaker on code::dive conference - check the [yt channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codediveconference). I haven't spoken about Go (yet), but there are some Go-related lectures in the archive and mine are (ostensibly) not completely unfunny (e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fa6-2YcT-Y))
